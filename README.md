**Overview:** In this Power BI project, we will analyse global health expenditure data to gain insights into different aspects of health spending across countries and regions. The dataset used in this project will contain information on health expenditure, GDP, population, and other relevant metrics.

**Objective:** The objective of this Power BI project is to analyse global health expenditure data to gain valuable insights into various aspects of health spending across countries and regions. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive and data-driven view of health expenditure trends, its relationships, and identify key patterns. The analysis aims to answer critical questions and support decision-making in the field of global healthcare,

**Key Learnings:** 
This project was a hands-on learning experience that enhanced my Power BI skills and analytical abilities. I gained proficiency in using Data Visualization tool to explore and analyse large datasets, extract relevant information, and draw valuable insights.

**Data Source:** 
We will use a dataset that includes 5 tables namely Country, Year, GDP, Population, Health Expenditure. Key Columns are:
CountryID: It contains unique identifiers to different countries
Country: Name of the country or region.
YearID: It contains unique identifiers to different years
Year: Year of the data record.
Health Expenditure: Total health expenditure in US dollars.
GDP: Gross Domestic Product in US dollars.
Population: Total population of the country or region.

**Insights:**
**Total Health Expenditure by Country for year 2020**
This graph gives the information about total health expenditure for year 2020. Here, we can see that Monaco has the highest expenditure followed by Luxembourg and Norway. Countries like Democratic Republic of Congo, Yemen, Netherlands are the countries with least expenditure. 

**Year to Year percent change in Health Expenditure**
This graph gives the information that in the year 2019, the expenditure decreases at a rate of 0.12%. Also, in year 2020 expenditure got increased at the rate of 10.3%.

**Total Health Expenditure by Country and Year**
This chart gives the information that in the year 2019 and 2019, Luxembourg has the highest expenditure. But in year 2020, Monaco has the highest expenditure. 

**Total Health Expenditure by Country**
Map gives us the information of countries and their health expenditure

**Total GDP and Total Health Expenditure by Country and Year**
Monaco is the country with highest GDP and Expenditure. This graph shows the total expenditure for the majority of countries is below 5855 and the total GDP for the majority of countries is 15040.

**Reccomendation**
Country with highest GDP Share is Kiribati and Country with lowest GDP Share is Haiti. The GDP Share is highest in 2020 and lowest in 2018. 
The average ratio of total health expenditure and population is 0.15, which is very less as compared to population. Each country should increase their health expenditure to meet the needs of rising population. 

**Conclusion**
I thoroughly enjoyed working on this Global Health Expenditure Analysis Prokect. It provided a valuable opportunity to apply Power BI skills to real-world data and gain insights into the health industry.
